# Prostate Health Index (PHI) literature — 2020–2025

Scope: PHI = Prostate Health Index. Focused on 2020–2025, prioritizing PubMed-indexed articles with abstracts. Google Scholar items largely overlap; PubMed links provided for reliable abstracts.

1) Prostate health index (PHI) as an accurate prostate cancer predictor (2023, J Cancer Res Clin Oncol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37204514/
   - Abstract (summary): Prospective study (n=140) comparing PHI vs tPSA for prostate cancer prediction. PHI discriminated better than tPSA (AUC PHI 0.77 vs tPSA 0.44). Multivariable modeling with PHI improved predictive accuracy (76% vs 72%). Conclusion: PHI improves detection over tPSA in this population.

2) PHI as a reliable biomarker for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis (2022, Clin Chem Lab Med)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35567430/
   - Abstract (summary): 60 studies (14,255 individuals). Pooled sensitivity/specificity for PCa: 0.791/0.625; for clinically significant PCa (csPCa): 0.874/0.569. Conclusion: PHI shows high accuracy for PCa and csPCa; useful for biopsy guidance.

3) PHI density outperforms PSA density in csPCa with equivocal MRI (2023, J Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036248/
   - Abstract (summary): Multicenter cohort (n=1,215). PHI density + PI‑RADS achieved AUC 0.85, superior to PI‑RADS + PSA density (0.81) or PHI (0.78). In PI‑RADS 3 lesions, PHI density reduced unnecessary biopsies more than PHI or PSA density.

4) Initial PHI and PHI density predict 6‑year csPCa risk after negative biopsy (2022, Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34453109/
   - Abstract (summary): In men with PSA 4–10 ng/mL and initial negative biopsy (median follow‑up 77 months), higher baseline PHI/PHID associated with future PCa and high‑grade PCa. Proposed thresholds (e.g., PHI ≥35; PHID ≥1.2) identify higher‑risk follow‑up groups.

5) Cost‑effectiveness analysis of PHI for initial biopsy (2020, Front Oncol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33330035/
   - Abstract (summary): Decision model (n=3,348) suggests PHI (cutoffs 23–35) reduces unnecessary biopsies 22–50% and is cost‑effective; cutoff 27 recommended across PSA ranges.

6) Two‑year prospective evaluation of PHI in routine pathway (2025, BJU Int; ePub 2024)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38961793/
   - Abstract (summary): Population‑scale implementation (Hong Kong; n=2,828). Knowing PHI, 83% with elevated PSA chose no biopsy; higher PHI (≥35) linked to higher initial and subsequent GG≥2 detection. PHI supports individualized biopsy decisions.

7) PHI/PHID in PI‑RADS 3 lesions (2023, Urol Int)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38011845/
   - Abstract (summary): In PI‑RADS 3, PHI (AUC 0.786) and PHID (0.763) outperformed PSA metrics for PCa and csPCa prediction. Conclusion: PHI best diagnostic value in PI‑RADS 3; PHID elevates csPCa risk discrimination.

8) PHI stratifies PI‑RADS 3 to reduce biopsies (2024, Asian J Androl)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37695241/
   - Abstract (summary): Among PI‑RADS 3 men, csPCa detection varied by PHI groups: <25 (5.3%), 25–34.9 (7.4%), 35–54.9 (17.9%), ≥55 (52.6%). PHI‑guided triage could avoid biopsy in low‑PHI with small miss rate.

9) PHI predicts progression during active surveillance (2025, World J Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40650759/
   - Abstract (summary): Low‑risk PC under active surveillance (n=77). Higher baseline PHI associated with pathological progression; diagnostic AUC 0.641. PHI may aid progression risk stratification.

10) PHI vs mpMRI for csPCa diagnosis in biopsy setting (2021, World J Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32761380/
   - Abstract (summary): In 395 men, PHI AUC 69.7 (vs PSA 59.5, PSAD 64.9, PIRADS 62.5). Adding PHI to PIRADS significantly improved csPCa prediction. PHI useful for pre‑MRI or pre‑biopsy triage.

11) PHI + 18F‑PSMA‑1007 PET/MR for PCa diagnosis (2024, Asian J Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39534010/
   - Abstract (summary): Prospective n=41. PET/MR added to PHI improved AUC (0.802 vs 0.692) and reduced unnecessary biopsies; gains limited for PHI ≥43.5.

12) PHI as triage to reduce MRI (2024, Clinical Biochemistry)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38583655/
   - Abstract (summary): In suspected PCa, PHI best predicted PI‑RADS ≥3 (AUC 0.747); best PHI cut‑off 30 (90% sensitivity). PHI independently predicted MRI positivity.

13) PHI + mpMRI to predict grade reclassification in AS (2020, BJU Int)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32367635/
   - Abstract (summary): In AS cohort (n=253), combining PI‑RADS ≤3 with PHI threshold raised NPV to 98% and increased AUC vs MRI alone; may avoid ~20% of biopsies with minimal missed upgrades.

14) %p2PSA and PHI outperform PSA/%fPSA for csPCa; reflex use (2022, Arch Pathol Lab Med)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34343237/
   - Abstract (summary): In PSA 2–10 ng/mL (n=237), %p2PSA (AUC 0.781) and PHI (0.814) exceeded PSA and %fPSA. Using PHI ≥27 or %p2PSA ≥1.25% spared 25–29% biopsies with ~10% csPCa misses.

15) PHI density for biopsy strategy in PI‑RADS v2.1 3 lesions (2024, JMRI)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38299766/
   - Abstract (summary): Biopsy‑naïve PI‑RADS 3 (n=193). PHID AUC 0.793 (best). Two PHID cutoffs could avoid ~48% biopsies with ~5% csPCa miss; lowest “borderline” cohort vs PSA/PHI.

16) Prospective comparison: PHI/PHID vs %fPSA for csPCa (2023, Transl Androl Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37032752/
   - Abstract (summary): n=296 undergoing biopsy; PHID (AUC 0.880) and PHI (0.867) outperformed PSA derivatives overall and within PSA 4–10 gray zone.

17) Beyond PSA: the role of PHI (2020, Int J Mol Sci — Review)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32053990/
   - Abstract (summary): Narrative review of blood/urine biomarkers; PHI associated with aggressive PCa; compares PHI with 4Kscore, Stockholm3, and urinary tests.

18) PHI in active surveillance risk (2022, J Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35830553/
   - Abstract (summary): Canary PASS analysis (n≈1,142; 1,532 biopsies). Adding PHI modestly improved prediction at confirmatory biopsy (ΔAUC +0.021) but not subsequent biopsies.

19) Combine PHI and PI‑RADS before biopsy (2025, Int J Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40098218/
   - Abstract (summary): n=105 with both MRI and PHI. PHI AUC 0.816 vs PI‑RADS 0.753 for PC; restricting biopsy to PI‑RADS ≥4 or PHI ≥38.1 could avoid ~21% biopsies with minimal csPCa miss.

20) PHI + serum testosterone to predict BCR after RP (2023, Arch Esp Urol)
   - Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38186072/
   - Abstract (summary): RP cohort (n=132). PHI and testosterone independently associated with biochemical recurrence; combined AUC 0.906 for BCR prediction; higher PHI and lower testosterone linked to worse RFS.
